# About this folder
The point of this folder is to given an example of how the private 'api-keys' repo 
should be laid out.

It also contains *travis.enc* which shouldn't be in 'api-keys', but is used
to allow Travis access to 'api-keys' so it can deploy. See https://github.com/UXSoc/UX-glitch/blob/master/Documentation/EXTRAS.md#generate-keys
